Newsletter

In a team all kind of exciting stuff happens. One way to create transparency within the organization (apart from Demos, Townhall meetings, Community of Practices, etc.) is to send newsletters from the team. 

As interesting things happen, add a bullet to the Newsletter content list. Write a paragraph about it in the shared document. When you have six news items to share, convert the document into an email and send to your colleagues. Writing the newsletter could be a rotating responsibility. The person who is supposed to write the next newsletter has his or her avatar next to the list.
